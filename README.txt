A programm designed to provide an easy to use Trip manager for companies and\or users. Main goal was to apply the basics of OOP and get the gist of them.

Pros:
    Easy-to-Modify: OOP provides an intuitive structure, therefore anyone with basic OOP knowledge will be able to understand and change this code
    Readibility: Conscious effort was made in order to make this code readable and easy-to-understand
Cons: 
    Sorting: In sort method the sorting alghoritm used is bubble-sort which is simple and not efficient, should be changed to something more advanced like FastSort
    Check: Lots of similiar checks, should be made as seperate functions to avoid code repetition
Ways-to-Improve:
    Change sorting method in sort function, create separate functions for checks, create WriteToFile function which will create a .csv file with every trip listed at the end of the program work. Create UI, create ways to work with different .csv files simultaneously, add .xlsm files support.
